                    FOR THIS LICENSE!

                     End of Summary

                        Preamble

The Keep It Free license aims to be a copy-left free license for 
all kinds of work and designed to encourage contribution with
the community.

The license is also designed to ensure that work derived from
the original work(s) remain free and open-source. 

With this license, I hope to negate the possibilty of an 
individual/company/clan/group of people make free open-source
work(s) into proprietary products. Additionally, it enforces
any work(s) that uses this license must disclose the
human-readable source code without need of a request; in
other words, no one should have to send an e-mail to request
for the source code. 

                    Terms and Conditions

    "Licensee" - any individual, company, organization to abide
    by this license; also known as you, the reader.

    "any party" - licensor, licensee(s), and copyright holder.

    "Source code" - the original programming language that
    a person uses as originally written with the means to make

    License remains in effect until the copyright hold on the program
    expires, or if the license is terminated. 

    2. Termination

    Unless otherwise written by the copyright holder, the copyright 
    holder is the only person who may terminate this license.

    Unless expressed by the copyright holder in written form, if a 
    licensee uses an older version of the source code with the license 
    non-terminated, the license is still in effect. If a licensee 
    uses  a version of the source code where the license is terminated,
    the license is terminated unless re-established in a later version.
    

    Any violation in this license's terms of conditions, results in the 
    termination of the licensees rights under this license.

    In the event that a licensee's rights are terminated, the licensee
    must seize all operations and information permitted by this license.

        any persons ability to have access to the source code and
